A multi-day journey into failing at starting a blog.

## Choosing Github

I understood how the internet worked ~2005. Javascript barely existed, CSS barely existed. Most pages were static, those that were dynamically created were generated with php. 

Fastforward 15 years and now I know almost nothing about how the internet really works. Now we have javascript, css generated by sass, ruby interpreting markdown to make static pages, hundreds of AWS lambdas executing in directed acyclic graphs to build a page on the fly while. For anyone who understands how the web really works, the above paragraph will read as woefully uninformed. Anyway, I chose github because it's free and has a nice guide on how to get started that absolutely didn't work (because I tried to be clever).

### What not to do

I started at [About Github pages and Jekyll][gj-about](reccommended reading for the beginner). And then tried to follow the guide [Creating a Github pages site with Jekyll][gj-create]. Which I did a bad job of (and ran into issues).

The general gist of what I did (I have a windows machine):
1. Start reading the [Creating][gj-create] guide above.
    1. Realize I need to install Jekyll. [Install Jekyll for Windows][jekyll-install]
        1. Realize I need ruby. Download and install the `Ruby+Devkit` version from [RubyInstaller Downloads][ruby-downloads]
        2. Install [Jekyll][jekyll-install] amd [bundler][bundler] using gem (the package manager for ruby).
        
          In a *new* powershell or command prompt (needs to be new to make sure the system can find the newly installed *gem*)
          
          ```bash
          gem install jekyll bundler
          ```
    2. Create a new repo *martyblaber.github.io*, so full path is https://github.com/martyblaber/martyblaber.github.io and create a blog folder. *Terrible Idea*
        - Spend hours trying to get this to work and finally give up and move everything to the root directory of the repo.
            - You can't use commands like `git mv blog/* ./ -k` in a command prompt or powershell because the `*` is not interpreted properly. Instead, use *git bash* to run `git mv blog/* ./ -k`. The `-k` is to ignore files that aren't being tracked. The leftover stuff in `blog/` can be removed with `rm -rf blog/*`. You should check if there's anything important in there before doing this!
    3. Eventually, I had a working page. Time to install a theme. *Disaster*
        1. I couldn't get the `leap-day` theme to work based on the [theme guide on github][theme-github].
        2. One of the many issues I had with local debugging was jekyll / ruby 3 not having the right dependencies. So install webrick and add webrick to the gem file:
            
            In a powershell or command prompt.
            
            ```bash
            gem install webrick
            ```

            Add webrick to the end of the Gemfile.

            ```ruby    
            gem "webrick"
            ```
        3. Looking back on my gemfile. Maybe this whole problem was created by jekyll being commented out:
        https://github.com/martyblaber/martyblaber.github.io/blob/broken-leap-day/Gemfile
            ```ruby
            # Happy Jekylling!
            #gem "jekyll", "~> 4.2.2"*
            # This is the default theme for new Jekyll sites. You may change this to anything you like.
            #gem "minima", "~> 2.5"
            gem "github-pages", group: :jekyll_plugins
            # If you want to use GitHub Pages, remove the "gem "jekyll"" above and
            # uncomment the line below. To upgrade, run `bundle update github-pages`.
            gem "github-pages", "~> 226", group: :jekyll_plugins
            # If you have any plugins, put them here!
            group :jekyll_plugins do
                gem "jekyll-feed", "~> 0.12"
            end
            ```
    

### What do do instead (h3)


Phasellus et hendrerit mauris. Proin eget nibh a massa vestibulum pretium. Suspendisse eu nisl a ante aliquet bibendum quis a nunc.

### Some great subheading (h3)

Praesent varius interdum vehicula. Aenean risus libero, placerat at vestibulum eget, ultricies eu enim. Praesent nulla tortor, malesuada adipiscing adipiscing sollicitudin, adipiscing eget est.

> This quote will *change* your life. It will reveal the <i>secrets</i> of the universe, and all the wonders of humanity. Don't <em>misuse</em> it.

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Fusce bibendum neque eget nunc mattis eu sollicitudin enim tincidunt.

### Some great subheading (h3)

Vestibulum lacus tortor, ultricies id dignissim ac, bibendum in velit. Proin convallis mi ac felis pharetra aliquam. Curabitur dignissim accumsan rutrum.
