I don't know anything about magnetism and I love to read about people who use cheap electronics to build very capable (i.e. expensive) devices. So, I really enjoyed Youtuber [etischer's](https://www.youtube.com/user/etischer/) EV conversion ([details on his website here](http://etischer.com/awdev/)). In one of his videos, [he blows up his IGBT stack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmqJ6Oruh2A&t=255s). etischer says the reason for the failure was "Too much inductance between the DC bus caps and the IGBTs". This got me curious about how to design a DC bus to minimize the inductance.

Basically all industrial and electrical vehicles motors are AC induction motors. I recommend Electrobooms videos on [Induction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XYdTogWcIA) and [AC Motors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7Rg0TcHQ4Y). They're entertaining and provide the necessary background for this post.

The U.S. Department of Energy's [Office of Scientific and Technical Information](https://osti.gov) has an IEEE article by Gui et al, 2019 ([OSTI Link](https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1761739) & [DOI 10.1109/ECCE.2019.8912605](https://doi.org/10.1109/ECCE.2019.8912605)) on the design of power converters using "3L ANPC" which stands for "3-level active neutral point clamped". This is a fancier way to get from DC --> 3-phase AC. The idea is that you split the input supply into two. The OSTI article by Gui et al cites some others, like [Zhu2013](https://www.benthamopen.com/contents/pdf/TOEEJ/TOEEJ-7-98.pdf), which is a little more straightforward. The overall strategy is to make the bus bars from parallel copper plates and organize the components so that there is always current flowing in opposite direction through the sheets. 

Here is an example setup:

The equation for describing the inductance for the parallel plates above, is:

$$ L = \frac{\mu_0 \mu_r l }{\pi}\left(\frac{1}{4}+\frac{4h}{h+w}-\frac{2h}{\sqrt{4(d+h)^2+kw^2}}\right) $$

Note the $$ k $$, which is a 

NIST has a great book with many [formulas for the inductance of common geometries](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/bulletin/08/nbsbulletinv8n1p1_A2b.pdf)

I thought about doing some FEM modelling of inductance with [mfem](https://mfem.org/), but then I found [AI-MAG](https://ai-mag.github.io/), which could be faster.
