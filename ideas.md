A place for me to remind myself what I want to blog about.

## Lasing into the void.
Lasing cavity for keeping things cool.
The atmosphere has very high transmittance at ~10um. Folks have used SiC microparticles that have emission tuned to ~10-13um wavelengths. It's possible to cool a surface down to a few degrees C. 
I wonder if it's possible to concentrate this energy into a cavity and have stimulated emission to cool a block of material down.

## Lifting a rocket with a gyrotron.
Gyrotrons are all the rage at the moment. Someone had (the very good) idea to try and use one for drilling. The feature that makes gyrotrons great as drills is that there is no drill head that has to contact the rock. Also, the gyrotron itself uses a cavity to generate the EM field. Because there is no lasing medium, the internal power absorption can be very low too.
How do we lift a rocket with this infromation? I don't know yet. We can't easily convert the energy back into electricity - 


## Building a gate (2022-07-15)
Using FreeCAD to do structural analysis of a gate.
Nice discussion of von Mises Stress.

## Explaining Principle Component Analysis using real data (2022-07-05)
I would like to create a simple example of PCA that covers the importance of dimensionality reduction in a way that is engaging and understandable for highschool students.
I found this wonderful link

## Maximum Likelihood Estimation (2022-05-22)
This is the topic I started the blog for.
I actually want to write some Monte Carlo code for estimating the error in Weibull distributions, but I think it's too slow in Python, so I thought I'd try writing the same fitting code in Python, Julia and C.
